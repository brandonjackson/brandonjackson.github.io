            <h1>Hiya! My name is Brandon Jackson. I’m a product leader finding ways that tech can genuinely improve lives.</h1>

        <p>I’m currently building public-interest AI infrastructure at as Head of Product at <a href="https://openfn.org">OpenFn</a>, a leading digital public infrastructure startup. Recently, I've led transformative AI scenario planning workshops with UK government officials and leading economists with the Windfall Trust. Previously, I designed the <a href="https://globaldialogues.ai/">Global Pulse,</a> set of indicators to track AI's societal impact with the <a href="https://cip.org">Collective Intelligence Project.</a> I was a founding member of the Public AI Network, a community making the case for how <a href="https://publicai.network/whitepaper">how Public AI infrastructure</a> can level the playing field for innovation. I also proposed a <a href="https://www.chathamhouse.org/2024/06/artificial-intelligence-and-challenge-global-governance/07-uk-needs-british-ai-corporation">British AI Corporation</a>, modelled on the BBC, in an essay for Chatham House.</p>
        
        <p>Previously, I have been a product manager at some of London’s best startups. I built a CarPlay app to scale access to <a href="https://justpark.com">JustPark</a>’s unique supply of decentralized parking spaces, helped people see how their bodies respond to food in real-time at <a href="https://zoe.com">Zoe</a>, helped preschoolers in China speak their first original English sentences at <a href="https://lingumi.com">Lingumi</a>, and designed construction kits that brought the joy of creating with code to children worldwide at <a href="https://kano.me">Kano Computing</a>.</p>

        <p>Outside of work, I am passionate about exploring the intersection of painting, architecture, and neuroscience. I have built my own traveling oil painting setup from a cigar box, trekked to distant glacier fields to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DB8e6dqN64y">paint unusual light conditions</a>, given <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230827224637/https://programme.openhouse.org.uk/listings/11979">walking tours about sensing space</a> as part of London’s Open House festival, and most recently taught a <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1eEP3032uF8ULEfmPpDzPoZgy0NBoSbAQ5v7At8jpzNk/edit?usp=sharing">painting workshop for neuroscientists</a> at MIT.
